# Blockchain Mining Simulation

This project implements a simple blockchain structure with mining functionality, focusing on Proof of Work (PoW) and difficulty adjustment. It simulates how blockchain mining operations work, demonstrating how miners compete to create blocks that meet specific criteria in terms of hash values.

## Task 1: Setting Up the Blockchain Environment

### Objective:
Implement a basic blockchain structure capable of supporting mining operations.

### Instructions:
1. **Define the Block Structure**: 
   - Implement a block structure in C that includes the following fields:
     - `index`: The position of the block in the chain.
     - `timestamp`: The time when the block was created.
     - `transactions`: A list of transactions represented as strings or integers.
     - `previous_hash`: The hash of the previous block in the chain.
     - `nonce`: A number used to generate a valid hash for mining purposes.
   
2. **Implement SHA-256 Hashing**:
   - Integrate or implement the SHA-256 hashing function to compute block hashes.

### Example Block Structure:
```c
struct Block {
    int index;
    char timestamp[64];
    char transactions[256];
    char previous_hash[64];
    int nonce;
    char hash[64];
};
```

## Task 2: Implementing Proof of Work (PoW)

### Objective:
Develop the proof-of-work mechanism to secure blockchain creation.

### Instructions:
1. **Calculate Hash**:
   - Implement a function to calculate the hash of a block.
   - This function should iteratively change the nonce value until the hash meets the difficulty criteria (e.g., starts with a certain number of leading zeros).
   
2. **Proof of Work Mechanism**:
   - Miners compete to find a nonce that generates a valid hash.
   - The difficulty can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the number of leading zeros required in the hash.

### Example of PoW Function:
```c
int proof_of_work(struct Block *block, int difficulty) {
    char hash[64];
    while (1) {
        // Calculate hash of block
        calculate_hash(block, hash);
        if (meets_difficulty(hash, difficulty)) {
            return block->nonce;
        }
        block->nonce++;
    }
}
```

## Task 3: Mining a Block

### Objective:
Simulate the mining process to add a new block to the blockchain.

### Instructions:
1. **Simulate Mining**:
   - Create a function that:
     - Takes a list of transactions and the previous block's hash as inputs.
     - Mines the new block by finding the correct nonce using the proof of work function.
     - Adds the new block to the blockchain once a valid nonce is found.
   
2. **Verify Blockchain Integrity**:
   - After mining, verify the integrity of the blockchain to ensure the PoW is valid and that no block has been tampered with.

### Example Mining Function:
```c
void mine_block(struct Blockchain *blockchain, char *transactions) {
    struct Block new_block;
    new_block.index = blockchain->length;
    strcpy(new_block.previous_hash, blockchain->blocks[blockchain->length - 1].hash);
    strcpy(new_block.transactions, transactions);
    
    // Find the correct nonce
    proof_of_work(&new_block, blockchain->difficulty);
    
    // Add the new block to the chain
    add_block_to_chain(blockchain, new_block);
}
```

## Task 4: Adjusting Blockchain Difficulty

### Objective:
Understand how changing the difficulty affects mining time and computational effort.

### Instructions:
1. **Implement Difficulty Adjustment**:
   - Allow for dynamic changes to the PoW difficulty (i.e., the number of leading zeros required in the hash).
   
2. **Simulate Mining with Different Difficulties**:
   - Simulate mining blocks with various difficulty levels and track the time and resources needed for each level.
   
3. **Analyze the Impact**:
   - Observe how difficulty changes impact mining times and computational effort.

### Example Difficulty Adjustment:
```c
void adjust_difficulty(struct Blockchain *blockchain, int new_difficulty) {
    blockchain->difficulty = new_difficulty;
}
```
